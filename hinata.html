            Hinata Hyuga is a member of Team 8<b> who suffers from a lack of self-confidence.</b> Though born of the Hyuga clan's main house and raised to become future head of the clan, Hinata's shyness and inability to stand up for herself resulted in the strong disapproval of her father Hiashi after being defeated by her younger sister Hanabi, who became their father's successor. Hinata was then disowned by Hiashi and placed in the care of Kurenai Yuhi. Under Kurenai's guidance, Hinata began training her strength in both skill and will in order to prove her worth to her father. Hinata's growing self-confidence mainly comes from her long-standing admiration for Naruto, as she is inspired by his enthusiasm and unyielding determination to never give up. As the series progresses,,<b> Hinata's admiration towards Naruto eventually grows into love.</b> During Part II, Hinata confesses her feelings to Naruto while protecting him from Pain and later assists him during the Allied Ninjas' battle with the Ten-Tails.Following the end of the Fourth Great Ninja War, and the events of The Last: Naruto the Movie where she carries out the will of her ancestor Hamura ÅŒtsutsuki by helping Naruto stop Toneri, <b>Hinata marries Naruto and they have two children by the series epilogue.</b><br><br>
