            Kakashi Hatake is the easygoing,<b >smart leader of team 7</b>, consisting of Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. Kakashi had a dark past, but is unaffected by it as an adult. He was a very vital key for Naruto's success, training him to be a great ninja. Like Sasuke, Kakashi is also a <b>master of the Sharingan</b>, which he gained as a present from his late friend, Obito Uchiha, and can manipulate "Lightning Blade" similar to Sasuke's Chidori. Facing Obito after learning he survived and became apprentice of Madara's, Kakashi's original eye was restored late into series's second half and briefing regaining the Sharingan when Obito aids him in spirit to help in the fight against Kaguya. Kakashi succeeds Tsunade as the Sixth Hokage after the Fourth Great Ninja War have ended, with Naruto succeeding him years later.Kakashi was originally created by Kishimoto to be a harsh teacher but the author decided to avoid that. Instead, he made him more generous to calm his students in difficult situations to the point of giving him feminine traits.<br><br>
